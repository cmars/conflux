conflux - Distributed database synchronization
==============================================

Conflux synchronizes data by unique content-addressable identifiers.
It does this by representing the entire set of identifiers with a
polynomial. The difference between the databases is represented as
a ratio of these polynomials. However, the polynomials are very large,
since they represent every identifier in the database. The difference
between databases is communicated by evaluating the difference ratio
at a number of constants. Through the magic of rational function
interpolation, the difference ratio can be reconstructed from these
data points.

This algorithm is described in the papers, ["Set Reconciliation with 
Nearly Optimal Communication Complexity"](http://ipsit.bu.edu/documents/ieee-it3-web.pdf) and 
["Practical Set Reconciliation"](http://ipsit.bu.edu/documents/BUTR2002-01.ps).
